# Handwritten Digit Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using PyTorch

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning project that focuses on the creation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The primary objective of this project is to train a GAN to generate realistic handwritten digits, particularly utilizing the MNIST dataset.

## Project Highlights
- Implementation of a Generator and Discriminator network in PyTorch.
- Training the GAN through an adversarial process to create realistic synthetic images.
- Visualization of the training progress, including loss functions.
- Generation of synthetic handwritten digits using the trained GAN.

## Network Architecture
- **Generator**: The Generator network takes random noise as input and progressively upscales it to produce synthetic images.
- **Discriminator**: The Discriminator network evaluates whether an input image is real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator).

## Training
The GAN undergoes a rigorous training process over multiple epochs. During training, the Generator aims to produce increasingly authentic images, while the Discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data. This adversarial training dynamic continues until the Generator can generate images that are indistinguishable from real handwritten digits.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook to train the GAN.
3. After training is completed, you can use the Generator network to generate synthetic handwritten digits.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- tqdm

## Results
The results of this project include the successful generation of realistic handwritten digits that seamlessly blend with the MNIST dataset. You can find the sample generated digits in the `sample_generated_digits.png` file.

## Future Directions
While this project has achieved the goal of generating handwritten digits, GANs have a wide range of applications beyond image generation. Further exploration can lead to exciting developments in areas such as style transfer, data augmentation, and more.

## Contributions
Contributions and improvements to the code or documentation are welcome. Please submit a pull request.
